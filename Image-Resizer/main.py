#OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
import cv2

image = cv2.imread("codewithharry.jpg")
cv2.imshow('title', image) # Displaying the image
